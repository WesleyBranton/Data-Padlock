                <p>Encryption is the process that converts files and text into data that cannot be read unless it's decrypted. With Data Padlock, you can encrypt your files or text with a password using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). The data can then only be decrypted using the password that it was encrypted with.</p>
                <p>AES is an encryption standard used by organizations around the world including the US government!</p>
                <p>Unlike other encryption add-ons, you can encrypt your data entirely on your computer, without the need for the browser to send anything over the internet. You don't even need to be connected to the internet to encrypt something. No one involved with Data Padlock can see the password that you have entered or the original data.</p>

            <article>
                <p>While data sent over the internet is usually encrypted automatically, there are many reasons why you may want to encrypt your data before sending it or storing it on the web.</p>
                <p>Unless you encrypt your data, you are trusting that your internet provider and the web service you are using won't look at the data. In a world where personal privacy is rapidly vanishing, it's becoming common for tech companies to view the data that you are sending and use it for a variety of reasons, like ad targetting.</p>
                <p class="example">For example, if John uses the Sender app to send a message to Tina about dogs, Sender could read that message and begin showing them advertisements for dog toys. If John encrypts the message before sending it, Sender won't be able to read it.<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
                <p>Encrypting your data can also help prevent hackers from accessing it. This is especially important for sensitive data that's stored on the cloud.</p>
                <p class="example">For example, if Jessica saves a copy of her tax document on Big Cloud and hacker Jack breaks into her account, Jack could download and view Jessica's tax information. Or, if hacker Veronica manages to break into Big Cloud's servers and steal a bunch of data from Big Cloud users, she is able to read Jessica's tax documents. Encrypting the data before saving it to Big Cloud would help protect Jessica's information by creating an extra barrier for Jack or Veronica to attempt to break.<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>

                <h2>How do I create a good password?</h2>

            </div>
            <article>
                <p>Encryption is only as good as your password, so it's important to use a strong and unique password. This means using passwords that are long and contain at least one lowercase, uppercase, number and symbol. To help you create a strong password, Data Padlock includes a password strength meter.<sup><a href="#note-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
                <p>You should avoid using a password that contains words or phrases, even if you replace some of the letters with similar-looking numbers. You should also avoid using personal information (birthdays, dates, addresses, etc) and you should not reuse passwords.</p>
                <p>When storing a password you should not store them in a digital format, like a text file. Password managers are often a good tool for remembering passwords, but make sure that you are using a trusted service. If you must write down your passwords on paper, make sure that you keep it in a safe place where it cannot be found easily.</p>
                <p>When sharing a password with someone else (which you will need to do to allow a person to unlock encrypted files), you should do so out-of-band. This means that passwords should not be shared using the same service or method that you are using to share the file.</p>
                <p class="example">For example, if Robert is emailing a file to Sandra, he should not send the password through email. Instead, he could arrange to meet her in person or call her on the phone.<sup><a href="#note-1">[1]</a></sup></p>
