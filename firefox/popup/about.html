        <label>The internet is a scary place where you want stuff to stay private. <b>Secure Send is helping people reclaim their privacy!</b></label>
        <img src="image/animation1.gif">
        <p>If you send a letter in the mail and someone other than the intended recipient opens it, that letter is no longer private. <b>This is bad!</b></p>
        <p>Sadly, the same thing can <i>(and does)</i> happen on the internet.</p>
        <label>Secure Send helps to protect your messages from:</label>
        <ul>
          <li><i>Man in the middle</i> attacks</li>
          <li>Message logging</li>
          <li>Insecure messaging services</li>
          <li>Unauthorized account access</li>
          <li>Vulnerable computer networks</li>
          <li>And more...</li>
        </ul>

        <label>How it works</label>
        <p>Simply enter your message on Secure Send and set a password. We will lock your message using AES encryption <i>(an algorithm used by the US Government and worldwide)</i>. This transforms your message into garbled text that no one can read unless they unlock the message with your password.</p>
        <p>Next, send the Secure Send generated link to the message recipient. They will be prompted to enter the password to view the message and <i>(if they enter the correct password)</i>, they will be able to read the message.</p>
        <p><b>It’s that simple!</b></p>
        <p>Your message is <u>encrypted on your computer</u>, so you don’t have to worry about us <i>(or anyone else)</i> seeing your message. We don’t keep any record of your message or save it on our servers.</p>

        <b>&#x26A0; NOTE:</b>
        <br>
        You should share your message password with the intended recipient out-of-band, meaning not through the same messaging platform you use to share the message link.
        <br>
        <br>
        For example, if you email the link to your message, tell the recipient the password somehow other than email <i>(in-person, telephone, SMS messaging, etc.)</i>
