# Data Padlock [<img align="right" src=".github/fxaddon.png">](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/data-padlock/)
Data Padlock is a browser-based encryption add-on that allows users to preserve their privacy and security by encrypting files and messages with a password. The add-on uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (the same standard used by the US government), which provides a high level of security.

This powerful add-on can be used for a variety of purposes, like sharing messages or files over an unencrypted network or securing files you store in the cloud.

The process is simple! Just add select the file or type the message that you want to encrypt, enter a strong password and Data Padlock will generate an encrypted file that can be shared or saved. To access the file or message later, just select the encrypted file and enter the password to unlock it. It's that easy!

The encryption is performed entirely using the browser's built-in cryptography libraries, so your information isn't sent over the internet and no one involved with the Data Padlock project can see what you're encrypting.

Maintain your privacy with Data Padlock!
