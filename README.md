# Secure-Send
Any personal information sent over the internet is vulnerable to security threats like wiretapping. Thankfully, encryption exists to help protect data transmitted over the internet. Encryption is a process used to convert plain text into data that cannot be understood by anyone else but the intended receiver.

Secure Send uses the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) to locally convert your message into garbled text until the receiver enters the configured password. AES encryption provides a high level of security, so much so that it is used by the US government!

Secure Send is simple to use. Simply enter your text into the add-on, assign a password and the encrypted message will be added to your clipboard so that you can paste it into your instant messaging service or email client. When the receiver gets the message, they simply paste the encrypted text into the Secure Send add-on and enter the password.

Keep your private messages private with Secure Send!
